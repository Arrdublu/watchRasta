    "reasoning": "This Firestore structure is designed to support WatchRasta's content streaming, article publication, e-commerce, and user management features while adhering to the core principles of Authorization Independence, Clarity of Intent, DBAC (Database-Based Access Control), and QAPs (Rules are not Filters). It uses denormalization to achieve Authorization Independence, ensuring rules don't rely on `get()` calls. Structural Segregation ensures collections have homogeneous security postures, simplifying rules. The structure uses a membership map to manage collaborative data, and existence checks in dedicated collections to handle global roles.\n\n**Authorization Independence:** The `users/{userId}/profile` collection stores all user-specific data. There are no `get()` calls needed to verify profile information.\n\n**QAPs:** The `users/{userId}/profile` collection supports secure list operations because security rules can efficiently filter based on the user ID without requiring access to other collections.\n\n**Global Roles:** Dedicated collections (e.g., `roles_admin/{uid}`) are used for global roles; authorization is performed via existence checks instead of evaluating content, increasing rule efficiency."
